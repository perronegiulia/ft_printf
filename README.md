## Introduction

In the **ft_printf** project, you are tasked with creating a function that can replicate the behavior of the standard `printf` function found in the C library. Your `ft_printf` should be capable of handling various format specifiers, such as `%s`, `%d`, `%c`, `%p`, and many more, and printing formatted output to the console.

This project is a great opportunity to improve your knowledge of string manipulation, parsing, and memory management in C.

## Usage

To use the `ft_printf` function in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or copy the relevant source files to your project directory.
2. Include the header file `ft_printf.h` in your source code.
3. Call the `ft_printf` function with your desired format string and arguments.

## Features

- Support for various format specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%d`, `%c`, `%p`).
- Handles variadic arguments.
- Error handling for invalid format strings.
- Written in C language for portability.
